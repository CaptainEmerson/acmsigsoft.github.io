All ACM SIG events and communications abide by ACM’s policy against discrimination and harassment. All ACM SIG publications abide by ACM’s policies on plagiarism, misrepresentation, and falsification; on coercion and abuse in the ACM publications process; and on roles and responsibilities in ACM publishing. If a violation of any of these policies occur, ACM urges reporting the incident to the event chair or to ACM leadership, as indicated on those webpages.</description></item><item><title>SIGSOFT CARES Resources</title><link>https://acmsigsoft.github.io/docs/Website/SIGSOFT-CARES/RESOURCES/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://acmsigsoft.github.io/docs/Website/SIGSOFT-CARES/RESOURCES/</guid><description>ACM Resources
