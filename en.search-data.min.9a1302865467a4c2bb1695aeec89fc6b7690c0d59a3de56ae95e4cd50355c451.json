All ACM SIG events and communications abide by ACM’s policy against discrimination and harassment. All ACM SIG publications abide by ACM’s policies on plagiarism, misrepresentation, and falsification; on coercion and abuse in the ACM publications process; and on roles and responsibilities in ACM publishing. If a violation of any of these policies occur, ACM urges reporting the incident to the event chair or to ACM leadership, as indicated on those webpages. You may also report violations using the following forms:\nReport an ethics violation here. Report harassment, discrimination, intimidation, or violence here. Report a policy violation such as a conflict of interest violation, coercion, abuse, misrepresentation, plagiarism, falsification or abuse of publication process here. We recognize that reporting to a conference chair or an upper level ACM administrator can be intimidating, especially in the face of an already unpleasant experience. We have therefore established CARES: Committee to Aid REporting on discrimination, harassment, and related ethical violations.\nThe role of CARES is to serve as a resource comprising of well-known and respected people in the software engineering community who are approachable and willing to listen to and help people who experience or witness discrimination, harassment or other ethical policy violation, either at our events or related to ACM publications; the committee members can be a sounding board for these people and can provide advice on the steps necessary to have the matter further investigated by ACM. It is important to understand that for the matter to be reported, the person experiencing the incident must still themselves send the complaint to ACM where it will be handled according to ACM’s policies. The CARES committee cannot serve as an intermediary in that official process and it cannot be involved in any aspect of the handling of the complaint by ACM.\nThe motivation in providing a standing CARES committee is: (1) people are more likely to report harassment, discrimination or other ethical policy violations if familiar and respected members of the community are available for support, (2) unlike conference chairs, the members of the CARES committee will be chosen largely for their commitment and record on the targeted issues, (3) longer membership terms and an (eventually) established committee enable building experience and a record that inspires more trust for those considering coming forward about an incident, (4) committee members are expected to be physically present at our main events and work with event leaders to publicize their role, and (5) the presence of such a committee with respected and trusted members from the community assigned to watch for these issues should serve as a deterrent for such behavior as well as encourage us all to be aware of and speak up if we observe such behavior.\nWhat CARES does CARES is dedicated to providing completely confidential support to members of the software engineering community. We listen to members who come to us for advice or who just want to talk. If they would like advice on what kinds of actions they can take, we do our best to provide such advice.\nThe SIGARCH/SIGMICRO CARES committee and the SIGPLAN CARES committee led to foundation of this SIGSOFT CARES committee.\nThe SIGSOFT CARES Bylaws can be found here.\nA collection of CARES resources can be found here.\nConfidentiality and Privacy Policy # Consultations with SIGSOFT CARES members regarding harassment, discrimination, or inappropriate behaviour are confidential:\nYou will not be asked to share more than you want to share (including your name). No CARES member will forward to others more information than you want shared with others (you can choose to share nothing). You may ask a CARES member to play a supporting role in your filing a complaint to ACM (a listening ear, a sounding board, a support person at meetings), but they will not forward your information or file a complaint with ACM on your behalf. If you file a complaint with ACM, all parties involved in an investigation are required to treat shared information with the utmost discretion and confidentiality. UNLESS you say something that suggests that your or someone else’s safety is at risk, in which case a CARES member may be required to share enough information to ensure safety. The primary goal of CARES is to provide a safe place for you to discuss your experiences and to help you understand possible options, available resources, and next steps.\nCovered conferences # CARES members are always available by email to correspond and to set up a call with anyone who would like to speak with us about harassment, discrimination, or other concerns related to building and sustaining an inclusive research community.\nIn addition, one or more CARES members will act as (a part of) the Onsite Response Team at conferences by announcing their presence at the beginning of the meeting and at the business meeting, and being available for in-person conversations throughout the conference at sessions, breaks, associated meetings, etc. A CARES member will be available for email and phone calls for on-line PC meetings and other events associated with the conference. We will announce the CARES members attending below. At conferences, we will typically set up a table for at least an hour a day and announce the time and location. Initially, the following conferences will have guaranteed coverage.\nICSE ESEC/FSE ASE CARES committee members may also attend other workshops and conferences sponsored or co-sponsored by SIGSOFT, when they normally would attend. As the committee expands in membership, it may add conferences to the guaranteed list.\nConference CARES member attendees ESEC/FSE 2022 Kelly Blincoe, Gail Murphy, Marsha Chechik ICSE 2023 Andrew Begel, Bonita Sharif, Kelly Blincoe ASE 2023 Current Committee Members # You can contact all committee members by contacting sigsoft_cares@acm.org, or you can reach individual members of CARES using the contact information below.\nJoanne Atlee (she/her) University of Waterloo jmatlee@uwaterloo.ca Term: 2022-2025 Alexander Serebrenik (he/him) Eindhoven University of Technology a.serebrenik@tue.nl Term: 2022-2025 Kelly Blincoe (she/her) University of Auckland k.blincoe@auckland.ac.nz Term: 2022-2025 Andrew Begel (he/him) Carnegie Mellon University abegel@cmu.edu Term: 2022-2025 Bonita Sharif (she/her) University of Nebraska – Lincoln bsharif@unl.edu Term: 2022-2025 Gail Murphy (she/her) The University of British Columbia gail.murphy@ubc.ca Term: 2022-2025 Marsha Chechik (she/her) University of Toronto chechik@cs.toronto.edu Term: 2022-2025 Annual Reports # Our first annual report will be available in 2023.

He graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in mathematics from Princeton University. He then studied in Germany for a year as a Fulbright Scholar before earning his doctorate in mathematics at Cornell. A world-class fencer, Frank captained the Cornell team, was a two-time All-American in epee and NCAA Fencer of the Year in 1961, competed on two Pan-American teams, and was on the U.S. Olympic team in 1964. After earning his doctorate in mathematics at Cornell, Frank taught at the University of Puerto Rico, during which time he married Rita Rodriguez.\nFrank served as a faculty member in the departments of mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Kansas, the University of Auckland in New Zealand, and the University of Puerto Rico. Frank and Rita moved to Florida, where Frank served as a professor of computer science at the Florida Institute of Technology. Frank earned a second PhD, this time in Computer Science, at the University of Florida, and later served on the Computer Science faculty at the University of West Florida. In 1995, Frank joined the National Science Foundation in Washington.\nAt NSF, Frank directed the Software Engineering and Languages (SEL) Program for 5 years and played a key role in the Information Technology Research (ITR) Program. He co-chaired the Software Design and Productivity inter-agency committee. He advocated for a higher standard of scientific discipline in software engineering research, including emphasis on credible empirical research and practical use of formal methods and of fundamental models of software processes and products. He served as Deputy Division Director of the Computer-Communications Research Division of NSF\u0026rsquo;s CISE Directorate. One of Frank\u0026rsquo;s primary goals was supporting the crossover of ideas among research communities engaged in software research and development. As an outstanding scientist and recognized national leader in computer science, he worked toward this goal until his untimely death in 2004.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/Website/SIGSOFT-CARES/RESOURCES/","title":"CARES Resources","section":"SIGSOFT CARES","content":"ACM Resources\nPolicy Against Harassment at ACM Activities, by the ACM ACM Harassment and Discrimination Reporting Procedures, by the ACM Form for reporting violations of ACM code of conduct, by the ACM Addressing Harassment at ACM Events: Volunteer Training, by the ACM Information on inclusion and diversity\nThe diversity and inclusion revolution: Eight powerful truths, by Juliet Bourke Valuing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Our Computing Community, by Timothy Pinkston Information about implicit bias\nUnbiasing, by re:Work Implicit Association Test, by Project Implicit What We Know Now About Bias and Intergroup Conflict, The Problem of the Century, by Susan T.

By its existence, it seeks to discourage bad behavior and offer a friendly ear for community members to discuss their experiences confidentially.\nCARES governance policies The remainder of this document outlines the policies for governance of the CARES committee, including chair rotation, membership, autonomy, and conflicts of interest on the CARES committee.\nThe CARES committee was initially formed in 2022 by SIGSOFT. The SIGSOFT executive committee appointed the initial members (Joanne Atlee (Co-Chair), Alexander Serebrenik (Co-Chair), Kelly Blincoe (Co-Chair), Andrew Begel, Gail Murphy, and Bonita Sharif).\nThe CARES committee is sponsored by SIGSOFT. This sponsorship is expected to continue in perpetuity, and any changes to the rules of governance must be approved by the SIGSOFT Executive Committee. However, CARES operates autonomously to increase the trust of all community members, to which the committee will offer support only in the best interests of the people who report incidents, and not for any other reason. CARES governance seeks to strike a balance in acknowledging the need for this autonomy, while also the need for support and stewardship by the SIGSOFT Executive Committee.\nCommittee member responsibilities The CARES committee commits to attend a certain number of professional meetings. Ultimately, the CARES goal is to have at least one but preferably two committee members present at all conferences sponsored by SIGSOFT, as well as the program committee meetings (as invited) for those conferences. To support this goal, committee members are expected to attend at least one such sponsored event per year. In unusual circumstances, travel and registration funding allowances may be available from SIGSOFT to cover the attendance of up to two CARES committee members in case no CARES committee members were otherwise planning to attend a guaranteed sponsored conference.\nAt each conference in the opening remarks, or other event early in the meeting, a committee member will announce the purpose of the committee, committee members present, and some of the particular events the members will attend. The announcement should be “inclusion positive.”\nCommittee co-chairs In steady state, at least two co-chairs will always serve. Each co-chair will serve for three years and appointments will overlap by 1.5 years, so that there will always be a serving co-chair with at least 1.5 years of experience. After serving as co-chair, the co-chair will normally remain on the committee for at least one more year.\nCo-chairs may be drawn from the current committee or the community at large. The current co-chairs will propose the next committee co-chair and will request input from the current CARES committee members and the SIGSOFT Executive Committee. Input should be provided in a timely manner. Co-chairs will then be approved by consensus of the CARES committee members and the SIGSOFT Executive Committee.\nCommittee member appointments Anyone may suggest potential committee members to the co-chairs, e.g., suggest your colleague or yourself. The SIGSOFT Executive Committee may also propose members. Committee members should be well known and respected community members to encourage reporting. Because of the gravity and personal nature of this committee, ensuring committee members are empathetic, trustworthy, and discreet is also of utmost import.\nThe co-chairs and current CARES committee members will vet potential committee members by seeking input from their collaborators, others who know the nominated people well, and the SIGSOFT Executive Committee. Only after this process will new members be invited by the co-chairs to serve. New members are encouraged to take inclusion and harassment prevention training courses. The CARES co-chairs will inform the SIGSOFT Executive Committee of any changes in membership in a timely manner.\nThere is no upper bound on the number of committee members. A lower bound of six members is suggested.\nCommittee members normally are invited to serve for a 3 year term, with a maximum of 6 years, served consecutively and a minimum of 6 years away from the committee before serving again. Committee members who serve as co-chair may serve longer to comply with the co-chair service policy of three years plus one year as prior-co-chair. After 3 years, the co-chairs will review the service of each committee member (e.g., conferences attended, etc.) and will normally invite members to renew.\nCommittee members serve at the discretion of the co-chairs and may be removed from the committee if they do not attend at least one conference or PC meeting per year, or other problems arise.\nEthics and conflicts of Interest Committee members will be held to the highest standards of conduct and discretion. They must abide by all their institutions’ rules, the ACM policy against harassment, and any other pertinent ACM rules. They may discuss incidents with other committee members, but may not otherwise discuss incidents, unless so directed by a person reporting an incident.\nIf an incident is reported to the ACM or other institutional body (that we become aware of) against a committee member, and that body determines that the report is credible, the member will be removed from the committee. If the committee is made aware of the complaint while the investigation is ongoing, the member will not represent CARES at conferences during the investigation.\nIf the person accused of harassment has a conflict of interest with the committee member who initially receives a report (e.g., advisor/advisee, collaborator, same institution, etc.), the committee member will refer the reporter to another committee member immediately.\nReporting to and oversight by the sponsoring organization Although CARES will work autonomously, the final responsibility for its appropriate functioning rests with the SIGSOFT Executive Committee. The CARES co-chairs will submit an annual report to the SIGSOFT Executive Committee indicating the conferences covered and the committee members attending these meetings. Individual incident reports and conversations with committee members are unequivocally private. The CARES report will therefore summarize the nature and scale of climate and harassment concerns within the community, but without inappropriate or confidential details. To align with other ACM reporting requirements, the report will be due July 15 and will cover the ACM fiscal year period of July 1 of the prior year to June 30th.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/docs/Website/Contact/","title":"Contact","section":"Welcome","content":" Chair: Thomas Zimmermann # Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98004 Phone: +1-425-703-8450 chair_SIGSOFT@acm.org Vice Chair: Marsha Chechik # University of Toronto chechik@cs.toronto.edu ACM Program Director for SIGSOFT: James Peeples # ACM Headquarters 1601 Broadway, 10th Floor New York, New York 10019-7434 USA Tel: +1-212-626-0603 Fax: +1-212-302-5826 peeples@hq.acm.org Social Media Chair: Sridhar Chimalakonda # Department of Computer Science and Engineering Indian Institute of Technology Tirupati, India http://researchweb.iitt.ac.in/~sridhar_ch ch@iittp.ac.in Refer to https://www.sigsoft.org/contact.html for the full listing\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/posts/creating-a-new-theme/","title":"Adding SIGSOFT CARES","section":"Latest News","content":" Adding CARES to the SIGSOFT Website # Adding CARES to the SIGSOFT Website\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/docs/Website/About/","title":"About","section":"Welcome","content":"The field of software engineering is generally considered to have begun with the 1968 and 1969 NATO Software Engineering Conferences.
