Purpose # CARES is a subcommittee of ACM SIGSOFT. All ACM SIG events and communications abide by ACM’s policy against discrimination and harassment. All ACM SIG publications abide by ACM’s policies on plagiarism, misrepresentation, and falsification; on coercion and abuse in the ACM publications process; and on roles and responsibilities in ACM publishing. If a violation of any of these policies occur, ACM urges reporting the incident to the event chair or to ACM leadership, as indicated on those webpages.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://acmsigsoft.github.io/docs/Website/Contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://acmsigsoft.github.io/docs/Website/Contact/</guid><description>Chair: Thomas Zimmermann # Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98004 Phone: +1-425-703-8450 chair_SIGSOFT@acm.org Vice Chair: Marsha Chechik # University of Toronto chechik@cs.toronto.edu ACM Program Director for SIGSOFT: James Peeples # ACM Headquarters 1601 Broadway, 10th Floor New York, New York 10019-7434 USA Tel: +1-212-626-0603 Fax: +1-212-302-5826 peeples@hq.acm.org Social Media Chair: Sridhar Chimalakonda # Department of Computer Science and Engineering Indian Institute of Technology Tirupati, India http://researchweb.iitt.ac.in/~sridhar_ch ch@iittp.ac.in Refer to https://www.</description></item><item><title>Creating a New Theme</title><link>https://acmsigsoft.github.io/posts/creating-a-new-theme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://acmsigsoft.github.io/posts/creating-a-new-theme/</guid><description>Adding CARES to the SIGSOFT Website # Adding CARES to the SIGSOFT Website</description></item></channel></rss>
